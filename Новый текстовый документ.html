      <i><b> Yaoi</b></i> (??? yaoi)The words yaoi and shounen-ai are often used by Western fans to distinguish between the content of a work. Usually, yaoi refers to manga and anime focusing on a predominantly sexual or even pornographic context, while shounen-ai focuses on a romantic context and side plots, respectively, at the same time, elements of both genres can overlap between them[3][4] [5]. For example, the original Gravitation can be seen as sh?nen-ai, as it focuses on the main characters' careers and their romantic relationships, while keeping their sex life off-screen. At the same time, the Gravitation Remix and Megamix doujinshi by the same author is treated as yaoi due to the characters' sexual relationship.
 
      The term was originally used to refer to ephebophilia or pederasty in Japan, but starting in the 1970s, shonen-ai began to be used as the name of a new variety of shojo manga from Soyuz 24, where romantic relationships between guys were at the center of the story. At first, the genre was distinguished by a rather idealistic narrative[6] and the frequent transfer of the plot to European realities[7]. Suzuki describes sh?nen-ai as being overly pedantic and difficult to understand, saying, 뉴 thorough understanding of sh?nen-ai often requires knowledge of history, classical literature, and the natural sciences. In addition, philosophical and abstract reflections can often be found in it. In her opinion, this developed the knowledge of the readers, as well as to find more in the work when reading it at an older age. On the other hand, it shifted the focus of shojo manga from a female character to a male character[8]. Since the 1980s, the popularity of shounen-ai has declined due to the increasing popularity of yaoi doujinshi[9]
